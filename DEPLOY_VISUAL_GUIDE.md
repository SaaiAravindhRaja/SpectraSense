# 🎯 SpectraSense - Visual Deployment Guide

## Your browser should now be open at Render Dashboard!

---

## 👉 Follow These 6 Easy Steps:

### Step 1: Click "New +" Button
```
Look for the blue "New +" button in the top right
Click it → Select "Web Service"
```

### Step 2: Connect GitHub
```
Click "Connect GitHub" (if not already connected)
Authorize Render to access your repositories
```

### Step 3: Select Your Repository
```
Search for: SpectraSense
Select: SaaiAravindhRaja/SpectraSense
Click "Connect"
```

### Step 4: Configure Settings (IMPORTANT!)

Your `render.yaml` should auto-fill these, but verify:

```yaml
✓ Name: spectrasense-ai
✓ Region: Oregon (US West) - or closest to you
✓ Branch: main
✓ Runtime: Python 3

Build Command:
  pip install -r requirements.txt

Start Command:
  gunicorn app:app

Instance Type:
  ✓ Free (512 MB RAM, $0/month)
```

**Environment Variables:** (Auto-set by Render)
- `PORT` → 8080
- `PYTHON_VERSION` → 3.11.0

### Step 5: Deploy!
```
Click the big blue "Create Web Service" button
Wait 5-10 minutes while Render:
  ⏳ Clones your repo
  ⏳ Installs dependencies
  ⏳ Loads ML models (70MB)
  ⏳ Starts your app
  ✅ Assigns your URL
```

### Step 6: Get Your URL!
```
Once deployed, you'll see:
🌐 https://spectrasense-ai.onrender.com

Or whatever name you chose!
```

## ✅ Test Your Deployment

Once "Live" badge shows green:

# Test health
curl $APP_URL/health

# Or just open in browser
open $APP_URL
```

You should see your beautiful glassmorphism UI! ✨

✅ Green "Live" badge appears
✅ URL is accessible

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

### Build Fails
**Error:** "ModuleNotFoundError"
**Fix:** Check that requirements.txt has all packages

### Model Loading Error
**Error:** "Can't find ultimate_model"
**Fix:** Ensure code/ directory is in your git repo
```bash
git add code/
git commit -m "Add model code"
git push
```

### Slow First Request
**Cause:** Free tier spins down after 15 min
**Normal:** First request takes ~30 seconds to wake up
**Fix:** Use UptimeRobot to keep warm (optional)
